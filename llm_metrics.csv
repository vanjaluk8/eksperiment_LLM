The burning of fossil fuels â€“ coal, oil, and natural gas â€“ releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to a gradual warming of the Earth's climate. The consequences of this warming are far-reaching and encompass a range of environmental and societal impacts.

One of the most visible effects of climate change is rising global temperatures. This leads to melting glaciers and ice sheets, contributing to rising sea levels. Coastal communities are increasingly vulnerable to flooding and erosion, and millions may be displaced.  Furthermore",200

## How a Combustion Engine Works: A Comprehensive Guide

A combustion engine is a heat engine that converts chemical energy (from fuel) into mechanical energy (motion).  The most common type is the **internal combustion engine (ICE)**, where the combustion of fuel happens *inside* the engine itself, driving pistons and ultimately creating rotational motion. This explanation will primarily focus on the four-stroke internal combustion engine, which is widely used in cars, motorcycles, and many other applications.

Title: Climate Change: A Global Crisis Requiring Urgent Action

Climate change, a pressing issue of our time, is a long-term alteration in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. This phenomenon is primarily driven by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.

The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and devastating. Rising global temperatures are causing polar ice caps to melt, leading to sea-level rise and coastal",200

A combustion engine, also known as an internal combustion engine, works by burning fuel in a confined space to create a high-pressure gas that moves a piston, which in turn drives a crankshaft and ultimately powers a vehicle or machine. Here's a simplified step-by-step process:

1. **Intake Stroke**: The intake valve opens, and the piston moves down, creating a vacuum that draws in a mixture of air and fuel into the cylinder.
