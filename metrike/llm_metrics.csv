More frequent and intense heatwaves put vulnerable populations at risk of heatstroke and other health problems. Changes in precipitation patterns are causing both droughts and floods, disrupting agriculture and threatening food",200

## How a Combustion Engine Works: Converting Chemical to Mechanical Energy

A combustion engine, also known as an internal combustion engine (ICE), is a heat engine that converts the chemical energy stored in fuel into mechanical energy, which can then be used to power vehicles, machinery, and more.  The most common type is the four-stroke engine, used in most gasoline-powered cars. Here’s a detailed explanation:

Title: Climate Change: A Global Crisis Requiring Urgent Action

Climate change, a pressing issue of our time, is a long-term alteration in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. This phenomenon is primarily driven by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.

The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and devastating. Rising global temperatures are causing polar ice caps to melt, leading to sea-level rise and coastal",200

A combustion engine, also known as an internal combustion engine, works by burning fuel in a confined space to create a high-pressure gas that moves a piston, which in turn drives a crankshaft and ultimately powers a vehicle or machine. Here's a simplified step-by-step process:

1. **Intake Stroke**: The intake valve opens, and the piston moves down, creating a vacuum that draws in a mixture of air and fuel into the cylinder.
