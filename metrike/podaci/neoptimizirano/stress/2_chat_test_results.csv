This sentence is a bit vague and doesn't provide much information about the project or the role. It's a bit too general and doesn't give the reader a clear idea of what the department is looking for.

**Revised Sentence:**

* ""We are seeking a qualified individual"" is a more active and engaging way to express the idea that the department is looking for someone.
