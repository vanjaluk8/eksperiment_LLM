Output whether the sentence implies positive, negative or neutral feelings between the two people. People: John and Jessica 
Sentence: John and Jessica went to a movie together. 
Output: Neutral 
Explanation: The sentence states that John and Jessica went to a movie together. This implies that they have a relationship where they can spend time together, but it doesn't necessarily imply any strong feelings between them. It could be a friendly outing or a casual date. Therefore, the feelings between them are neutral. 
Note: This problem requires you to analyze the sentence and the relationship between the two people and determine the feelings between them.

An electric current originates from the movement of charged particles, such as electrons, through a conductor. This movement is usually caused by an electric field, which is created by a difference in electric potential (voltage) between two points. The electric field exerts a force on the charged particles, causing them to move and create an electric current. This process is known as electromotive force (EMF).

The answer is multifaceted and involves a combination of government policies, individual actions, and technological innovations. Here are some effective ways to reduce pollution in developing countries:

1.  **Implementing and enforcing environmental regulations**: Governments in developing countries can establish and enforce strict regulations to limit pollution from industrial activities, transportation, and other sources. This can include setting standards for emissions, waste management, and pollution control technologies.

2.  **Promoting sustainable agriculture practices**: Many developing countries rely heavily on agriculture for their economies. Encouraging sustainable farming practices can help reduce pollution from agricultural runoff, which can lead to water pollution and harm aquatic ecosystems",200

Arithmetic mean is a measure of central tendency that represents the average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding all the numbers in the set and then dividing the sum by the number of numbers in the set.

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a field of study within Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves determining the emotional tone behind words to understand the attitudes, opinions, and emotions of a speaker or writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document.

In simpler terms, sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine whether a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. It's often used in social media monitoring, customer service, market research, and product reviews to gain insights into public opinion about a particular topic, brand, product, or service.",200
