**What is Classification?**

Classification is the process of assigning items to predefined categories based on their characteristics. It's essentially sorting things into groups.

**Key Components of Classification:**

1.  **Categories:** These are the predefined groups you want to classify your items into.  These need to be clearly defined.
2.  **Features:** These are the characteristics or attributes of each item that will be used to determine which category it belongs to.

This process, known as coalification, occurs when plant material is subjected to high temperatures and pressures over time, causing it to transform into a carbon-rich substance. Coal is a complex mixture of organic compounds, including carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. It is classified into four main types: lignite, subbituminous, bituminous, and anthracite, each with different properties and uses.

Coal is a major source of energy and is used in a variety of applications, including:
