The correct sentence should be:
""He realized he mastered the subject.""

Explanation:
The verb'realized' is in the past tense, and the subject 'he' is in the nominative case. The verb'mastered' is the correct form of the verb'master' in the past tense, which agrees with the subject 'he'. The sentence should be in the past tense to match the verb'realized'.

The correct sentence should be: 'He realized he had mastered the subject.'
Explanation: The verb tense should be consistent throughout the sentence. 'Mastered' is the past participle of the verb'master,' and it should be used with the auxiliary verb 'had' to form the past perfect tense. This is because 'he realized' is in the simple past tense, indicating that the realization occurred at a specific point in the past. To form the past perfect tense, we use 'had' + past participle ('mastered') to indicate that the action of mastering the subject occurred before the realization.

## Step 1: Define the perimeter of a square
The perimeter of a square is the total length of its boundary, which is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.

## Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the square
Since a square has four equal sides, the perimeter can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 4. Therefore, the perimeter P = 4a.

## Step 3: Define the area of a square
The area of a square is the amount of space inside its boundary.

To find the perimeter of a square, we need to add up the lengths of all its sides. Since all sides of a square are equal, the perimeter can be calculated as follows:
Perimeter = side1 + side2 + side3 + side4
Since all sides are equal, we can write it as:
Perimeter = a + a + a + a
Perimeter = 4a
Therefore, the mathematical equation for the perimeter of a square with sides of length a is:
Perimeter = 4a
The final answer is: $\boxed{4a}$. Find the mathematical equation for the perimeter of",200
