**Answer:** They were planning to launch a new website.

The original statement uses the present continuous tense (""are planning""). To change it to the past tense, we need to use the past continuous tense (""were planning""). This indicates that the planning activity occurred at a specific point in the past.

Alternatively, depending on the desired nuance, you could also say: ""They planned to launch a new website."" This uses the simple past tense and implies that the planning was completed or at least a definite decision was made.

College has always been seen as an important part of the American dream. It has been viewed by many as the ticket to a better life, providing access to better jobs and greater economic stability. It also gives individuals a chance to further their education, which can grant them more opportunities in the professional world. 

Unfortunately, the cost of attending college has skyrocketed in recent years; tuition costs and fees make college increasingly difficult for the average student to attend. Despite the costs, students continue to attend college, citing the need for new skills, increased job opportunities and increased earning potential.

In addition to the financial implications of college, students must also consider the social implications. College can be a stressful experience, and the pressure to perform academically can be overwhelming. Furthermore, it can be difficult to transition from the relatively sheltered lifestyle of living at home to living on one's own.

In conclusion, attending college immediately after high school comes with its share of risks, but it is possible to find success in this endeavor.

College has always been seen as an important part of the American dream. It has been viewed by many as the ticket to a better life, providing access to better jobs and greater economic stability. It also gives individuals a chance to further their education, which can grant them more opportunities in the professional world. 

Unfortunately, the cost of attending college has skyrocketed in recent years; tuition costs and fees make college increasingly difficult for the average student to attend. Despite the costs, students continue to attend college, citing the need for new skills, increased job opportunities and increased earning potential.

In addition to the financial implications of college, students must also consider the social implications. College can be a stressful experience, and the pressure to perform academically can be overwhelming. Furthermore, it can be difficult to transition from the relatively sheltered lifestyle of living at home to living on one's own.

In conclusion, attending college immediately after high school comes with its share of risks, but it is possible to find success in this endeavor. With proper planning, dedication and determination, the benefits of obtaining a college degree outweigh the risks.

Here's a breakdown of the essay's key points:

*   **Motivation:** Students pursue college for better job prospects and economic stability.
*   **Financial Barriers:** Rising tuition costs create a significant obstacle.
*   **Social Challenges:** College can be stressful and involve a challenging transition.
*   **Overall Assessment:** While risky, immediate college attendance can be successful with planning and dedication.

The sun appears red at sunset because of the way that light travels through the Earth's atmosphere.

The atmosphere scatters shorter (blue) wavelengths of light more than longer (red) wavelengths, a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering.
