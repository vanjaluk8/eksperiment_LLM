**Answer:**

A key benefit of the Roth 401(k) Plan is that **qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.**  

This is a significant advantage over traditional 401(k) plans, where withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Because you pay taxes *before* contributing (with after-tax dollars), your investment grows tax-free, and you don't owe any taxes when you take the money out in retirement.

The function y = x^2 - 5x + 6 is a quadratic function.
The graph of the quadratic function is a parabola.
Since the coefficient of x^2 is positive (1), the parabola opens upwards.
Therefore, the function has a minimum value, but no maximum value.
The function tends to infinity as x tends to infinity.

However, if we restrict the domain of the function, we can find a maximum value.
If the domain is restricted to a closed interval, we can find the maximum value.
