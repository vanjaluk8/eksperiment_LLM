**Example: The Pharmaceutical Industry and Patent Protection**

*   **Barrier:** Patent protection. Pharmaceutical companies invest heavily (billions of dollars) in research and development (R&D) to create new drugs.  A patent grants them exclusive rights to manufacture and sell that drug for a specific period (typically 20 years from the date of filing).
*   **How it Prevents Competition:**  During the patent period, other companies are legally prohibited from producing and selling the same drug.  This allows the patent holder to:

**Elaboration on Patent Protection:**

This significant upfront investment creates a high barrier for new entrants.  A smaller company with limited capital would find it nearly impossible to compete with a large pharmaceutical company that already has the infrastructure and resources.

For instance, a luxury yacht may require advanced technology, customized designs, and high-quality materials that are expensive to source. Additionally, the market for luxury yachts is relatively small, making it difficult for new entrants to achieve economies of scale. As a result, these factors create a high barrier to entry, limiting competition and allowing established players to maintain their market dominance.
