Encryption is a critical tool for protecting sensitive data and maintaining privacy in the digital age. Here are some key benefits of using encryption:

1. Confidentiality: Encryption ensures that only authorized individuals can access the data. It converts readable data into an unreadable format, known as ciphertext, which can only be decrypted by someone with the correct decryption key.
